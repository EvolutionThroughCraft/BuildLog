	worked w/ local build + remote db -- good milestone

	much more promising resource::https://springbootdev.com/2018/03/13/spring-data-jpa-auditing-with-createdby-createddate-lastmodifiedby-and-lastmodifieddate/

--so when we impl security, we can use that to get user :: for now going back to manual entry of user

--looks like the issue was I was missing 
@EnableJpaAuditing in the main file

trying local run or account (pointing at RDS), stamps did not set timestamps.  
	- Looking at the poms, take-4 was using 2.1.0 while account was using 2.1.1
	...this did not fix the problem

	- In the new (non-working) copy, I added Lombok @Getter & @Setter... maybe the setter is messing w/ something?
	-->nope

15:51
@Column can accept arg "nullable=false" & updatable=false
...there seems to be an ~= to nullable w/ @NotBlank
but I can't find anything to match updateable=false


15:00
I would like to pull everything in <prj>.service.common.*
out into some kind of abstraction, so that it can be used by the other services.  
For now though, since there is only account, I think the package-naming is specific enough

Adding application.properties to .gitignore on account of not wanting to push db-details to public repo.

per SO from 2yr ago :: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37404703/spring-boot-how-to-hide-passwords-in-properties-file
--apparently this is not a solved problem..?

gitignore is definitly a cheat, will need to talk to others about what long term solution should be
